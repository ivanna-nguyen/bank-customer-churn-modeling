# bank customer churn modeling
classification models to identify at-risk bank customers and improve retention strategy

## overview
this project uses the kaggle **bank customer churn dataset** to build and compare several classification models that predict whether a customer will churn (`1`) or stay (`0`). the focus is on finding a model that does the best job at **catching churners**, not just achieving high overall accuracy.

models compared:
- gaussian naive bayes
- logistic regression (with scaled features)
- k-nearest neighbors (knn)
- random forest classifier
